"""
Brainstorming

step by step
1) Add first connections to the frontier, based on Kevin Bacon
2) Pop one person node off of the frontier/Queue
3) Are they the Target?
  if yes: you're done, so compile and return particular node's path as output
  if no: use current node to push new nodes onto the frontier, with 2 considerations
    I) The new people to search are not already in the path
    II) They are one step away
4) Repeat steps 2 and 3
